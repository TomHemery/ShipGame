# ShipGame
Need to think of a flashier title for this.

This is a 2D top down space flight game, where you mine asteriods and fight bad guys. Developed mostly as a hobby, but hopefully I'll actually get it finished one day.

Started off as an android application, but I've since switched to PC as I feel like it better fits the aim of the game... as it were.

## Getting Started

For now to run the game please simply pull the main branch, and open it in a recent version of unity. 

### Prerequisites

In theory you should only need a recent version of unity.
