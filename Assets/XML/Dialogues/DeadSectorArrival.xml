    <prompt>There are definitely hostiles in this area, keep an eye out. 
You might well come across shielded pirates here, and there are small pockets of plasma residue from emp devices. 
EMP cannons will disable your shields, so try not to get hit by them okay?</prompt>

down some advanced pirates, but there's no more story beyond this yet. I hope you enjoyed the experience!</prompt>
